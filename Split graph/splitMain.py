About the code: 
 
A split graph is a graph in which the vertex set can be divided into
a clique and a set of independent nodes.
The algorithm traverses through the inputted degree sequence
and first checks if it satisfies the conditions to be a split graph
Once that is done, we generate the split graph by picking a m value 
i.e. the highest value of i for which diâ‰¤ i-1. 
This is followed by a function that checks if a degree sequence can 
be realized as a split graph

    #Once the user enters each node's degree, they're all appended into a list
